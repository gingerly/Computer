F: I(x,y) -> get good stuff. This is Computer Vision.

*Parametric Model: Class of instances where each instance has parameters.

*Choose a parametric model that best represents the feature.

Voting: 
1. Each edge point will cast the vote for say lines.
Take the lines that get many votes.

Find Lines:
y=mx+b.
x-> edge points.
y -> line.
(m,b) make the parameter space. Point in a image corresponds to line in parameter space.
Bin the parameter space and take the bin that has maximum votes.

Can you find perfectly vertical line?
Benefit of Polar Co-ordinates?
Note: a point in image-space is a now a sinusoid in parameter space.
